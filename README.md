# leaflet-challenge

This repository is for Module 15 leaflet challange. In this assignment, the first part, which is 'Create the Earthquake Visualisation', will be focused on.

logic.js
Datasets are pulled from earthquake web: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php by D3. In my example, All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days is used. Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude. All markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in colour. Popups are included to provide additional information, and a legend is placed in the bottom right corner.
